# Capstone-1




This is my capstone project the Repice maker

The overall flow of the project is users will log in and create over a 100 different repices and will be able to saved them. Anytime they want to access them they will be stored on their account




Some future add-ons I would like to have is more nutrition facts and infomation. I would also like to have recipe sharing with other, it could be helpful for example if people are trying diiferent recipes for dinner or to workout.
